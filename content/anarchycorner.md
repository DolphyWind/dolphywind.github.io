I regret installing github copilot now. LMAO it auto-completes this sentence as "It's too good, I'm not sure if I am learning anything". It is the opposite of good, the first
command I enter after opening nvim is usually "Copilot disable". Disappointing, it still tries to complete next sentences as "It's too good", poor thing I wish it had a conscience
and could see how stupid it is.

I thought vim users were wannabe cool kids. But the more I use vim, more I realize how much reaching for mouse slows me down. The amount of things vim allows you
to do is crazy. Seriously, it has no limits.

Documenting stuff is tiring.

I just wasted an hour debugging a program. Said program had no bugs, it was me running an old binary over and over again...
