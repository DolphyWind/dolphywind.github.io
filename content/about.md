Hello! My name is Yunus Emre Aydın. I am a Computer Science student at Istanbul University-Cerrahpaşa.
My interest towards computers started to develop during my childhood years. My programming journey began when
I got accepted to Besiktas Science and Art Center which is a public school for gifted students. Since then, I've written
countless lines of code and continue to write more. I am more focused on computer graphics at the moment, but I'd like to
delve into other areas in the future as well.
